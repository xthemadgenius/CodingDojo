/* 
  Params: nums, left, right
    - left and right are indexes, for now, left will be 0, and right will be the last idx
    - later these params will be used to specify a sub section of the array to partition

  Steps:

  1. Pick an number out of the arr to be your pivot value
    - usually from the middle idx, last idx, or a random idx

  2. Partition the array IN PLACE such that all values less than the pivot value are to the left of it
  and all values greater than the pivot value are to the right (not perfectly sorted)

  3. return: new idx of the pivot value or the index where the left section of smaller items ends

  "Choosing a random pivot minimizes the chance that you will encounter worst-case O(n2) performance (always choosing first or last would cause worst-case performance for nearly-sorted or nearly-reverse-sorted data). Choosing the middle element would also be acceptable in the majority of cases." https://stackoverflow.com/questions/164163/quicksort-choosing-the-pivot

/*
  Hoare’s partitioning scheme, named for Sir Charles Anthony Richard Hoare, who developed the quicksort algorithm in 1959.
  does fewer swaps than Lomuto
  NOTE that in this scheme, the pivot’s final location is not necessarily at the index that was returned (some edge cases)
  Time: O(n) linear despite nested loops because we still don't visit an index more than once
  Space: O(1) constant
