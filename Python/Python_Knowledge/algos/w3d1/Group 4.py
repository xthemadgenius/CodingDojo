# Balance Point <-- between indices

# Write a function that returns whether the given
# list has a balance point between indices, 
# where one side’s sum is equal to the other’s. 

# Input: [1,2,3,4,10]
# Output: true ( between indices 3 & 4 )

# Input: [1,2,4,2,1]
# Output: false 














# Balance Index <-- on and including index

# Here, a balance point is on an index, not between indices.
# Return the balance index where sums are equal on either side
# (exclude its own value).

# Return -1 if none exist.

# Input: [-2,5,7,0,3]
# Output: 2

# Input: [9,9]
# Output: -1
