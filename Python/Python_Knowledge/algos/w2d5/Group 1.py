# There are 9 coins, all except one are the same weight, the odd one is heavier than the rest. 
# You must determine which is the odd one out using an old fashioned balance. 
# You may use the balance twice. Explain how this can be done.

# find the heaviest group of 3 and then the heavest group within those 3.





# A windowless room contains three identical light fixtures, each containing an identical light bulb. 
# Each light is connected to one of three switches outside of the room. Each bulb is off at present. You are 
# outside the room, and the door is closed. Before opening the door you may play around with the light switches 
# as many times as you like. But once you've opened the door, you may no longer touch a switch. 
# After this, you go into the room and examine the lights. How can you tell which switch goes to which light?

# clarifying questions:


# Windowless room
# 3 identical light fixtures with identical light bulbs
# 1 light - 1 switch OUTSIDE room
# bulbs start OFF
# door closed, you are outside room
# answer - HEAT - THIS IS FINE

# You have 3 bags of marbles. One bag is labelled all red marbles. One bag is labelled all blue marbles. 
# One bag is labelled as a mix between red and blue marbles. All the bags are labelled incorrectly. 
# You may only pick one marble from one bag at a time. 
# How many marbles do you need to pull before you can figure out the correct labels for the bags?
# You can only pick one marble at a time

# clarifying questions: 
# bob what are statistics?
# can we open any of the bags to see all the marbles?

# bag 1 - label - all red marbles 
# bag 2 - label - all blue marbles
# bag 3 - label - mix red & blue

# we pick 1 marble out of mixed - it is blue (this tells us this is the blue bag, so the red bag is the mixed bag and the red bag is the mixed)
# only 1 pick is needed. 

#mixed bag 2blue -> when we pick the blue so it confirms it's the blue bag
#blue bag - 2 red -> since we know the blue bag is the mixed bag, we know this is supposed to be labeled red bag
#red bag - 1 blue 1 red -> since we know the mixed bag is supposed to be the blue bag, the blue bag is supposed to be the red bag, then this has to be the blue bag


# A Russian gangster kidnaps you. He puts two bullets in consecutive order 
# in an empty six-round revolver, spins it, points it at your head and shoots. 
# *click* You’re still alive. He then asks you, “do you want me to spin it again 
# and fire or pull the trigger again right away?” For each option, what is the 
# probability that you’ll be shot?

# 2/6 bullets 1/3 chance of being killed
# 4/6 empty 2/3 chance to be not killed

##### after the click #####
# 2/5 chance of being killed: 40%
# 3/5 chance of being safe: 60%

# Spin again
# 2/6 bullets || 1/3 chance of being killed: 33.33%
# 4/6 empty || 2/3 chance to be not killed: 66.66%
# 1/4 chances since only 1 bullet can be next vs 2

# 1/6 used after shot
# 2/5 if you dont spin since 1/6 was used
# 2/6 or 1/3 if you do spin bc reset


# Why are manhole covers circular?

# You’re about to get on a plane to Seattle. You want to know if it’s raining. 
# You call 3 random friends who live there and ask each if it’s raining. Each 
# friend has a 2/3 chance of telling you the truth and a 1/3 chance of messing
#  with you by lying. All 3 friends tell you that “Yes” it is raining. What is 
# the probability that it’s actually raining in Seattle? 

# You only need 1 of your friends to be telling the truth for it to be raining in Seattle.

# It’s fastest just to calculate the odds that all 3 are lying, and it’s not raining.

# Each friend has a 1/3 chance of lying. Multiply the odds together… you get 1/27 (1/3 * 1/3 * 1/3).

# We’re not done yet though… 1/27 is the probability that all 3 friends lied at the same time.

# The probability that at least 1 told you the truth? 26/27 or around a 96% that it’s raining in Seattle.


it's seattle... 100%
