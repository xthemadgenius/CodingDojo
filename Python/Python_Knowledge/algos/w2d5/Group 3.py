# There are 9 coins, all except one are the same weight, the odd one is heavier than the rest. 
# You must determine which is the odd one out using an old fashioned balance. 
# You may use the balance twice. Explain how this can be done.


1st you split the nine into 3 groups of three, weigh two groups of 3.
if one side of scale is heavier then the coin in on that side if not the coin is in the third group
then take the group of three coins with the heavier on in it and weigh 1 on 1 coins
if one side is heavier that's the coin, if both weigh the same the remaining coin is the heavier






# A windowless room contains three identical light fixtures, each containing an identical light bulb. 
# Each light is connected to one of three switches outside of the room. Each bulb is off at present. You are 
# outside the room, and the door is closed. Before opening the door you may play around with the light switches 
# as many times as you like. But once you've opened the door, you may no longer touch a switch. 
# After this, you go into the room and examine the lights. How can you tell which switch goes to which light?

1 light switch is never touched, bulb will be cold
1 light switch we turn on for a while, before entering the room we turn it off, that bulb will be warm
1 light switch is left on, the bulb that is on corrolates to that switch 





# You have 3 bags of marbles. One bag is labelled all red marbles. One bag is labelled all blue marbles. 
# One bag is labelled as a mix between red and blue marbles. All the bags are labelled incorrectly. 
# You may only pick one marble from one bag at a time. 
# How many marbles do you need to pull before you can figure out the correct labels for the bags?
# You can only pick one marble at a time

you only need to pick one marble, from the mixed bag
mixed = blue because mixed mixed
        blue bag, red bag, mixed

    blue  x         x      o
    red   o         x      x
    mixed x         o      x

# A Russian gangster kidnaps you. He puts two bullets in consecutive order 
# in an empty six-round revolver, spins it, points it at your head and shoots. 
# *click* You’re still alive. He then asks you, “do you want me to spin it again 
# and fire or pull the trigger again right away?” For each option, what is the 
# probability that you’ll be shot?


100% chance you'll be shot... it's a russian gangster

2/5 if continuous
then 1/2 if continous
then 2/3
then dead 

1/3 if spin it... always spin... do you feel lucky... do ya. punk

# You’re about to get on a plane to Seattle. You want to know if it’s raining. 
# You call 3 random friends who live there and ask each if it’s raining. Each 
# friend has a 2/3 chance of telling you the truth and a 1/3 chance of messing
#  with you by lying. All 3 friends tell you that “Yes” it is raining. What is 
# the probability that it’s actually raining in Seattle?
