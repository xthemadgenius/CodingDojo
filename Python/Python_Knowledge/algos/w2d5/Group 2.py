# There are 9 coins, all except one are the same weight, the odd one is heavier than the rest. 
# You must determine which is the odd one out using an old fashioned balance. 
# You may use the balance twice. Explain how this can be done.



# Break coins up into 3 groups of 3, 
# Weight groups 1 and 2 against each other, if they are of equal weight eliminate both, if one is heavier eliminate the other two.*args
# Take two coins of that group and weight them against each other, if one is heavier you'll know that it is the odd coin, if both are the same you'll know it's the third coin

# groups of 3 of groups on the scale



# A windowless room contains three identical light fixtures, each containing an identical light bulb. 
# Each light is connected to one of three switches outside of the room. Each bulb is off at present. You are 
# outside the room, and the door is closed. Before opening the door you may play around with the light switches 
# as many times as you like. But once you've opened the door, you may no longer touch a switch. 
# After this, you go into the room and examine the lights. How can you tell which switch goes to which light?


# Turn one light on, wait for 5 minutes, and turn it off, keep one light off, and turn one on,
# When you walk into the room you'll know which light is still "on' which light has always been off and which is warm so was on and has been turned off




# You have 3 bags of marbles. One bag is labelled all red marbles. One bag is labelled all blue marbles. 
# One bag is labelled as a mix between red and blue marbles. All the bags are labelled incorrectly. 
# You may only pick one marble from one bag at a time. 
# How many marbles do you need to pull before you can figure out the correct labels for the bags?
# You can only pick one marble at a time
 
# Pull a marble from the mixed bag--if it's red or blue you'll know it's either actually the red or blue bag.  then you can eliminate another option from the remaining two bags and assume which is which.*args


# A Russian gangster kidnaps you. He puts two bullets in consecutive order 
# in an empty six-round revolver, spins it, points it at your head and shoots. 
# *click* You’re still alive. He then asks you, “do you want me to spin it again 
# and fire or pull the trigger again right away?” For each option, what is the 
# probability that you’ll be shot?
