# Flexible Counter - Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, mult. 
# Starting at lowNum and going through highNum, print only the integers that are a multiple of mult. 
# For example, if lowNum=2, highNum=9, and mult=3, the loop should print 3, 6, 9 (on successive lines)

low = 2
high = 9
mult = 3

#              stop    
for i in range(high+1):
    print(i)

# My Walkabout froze, hopefully you can see this!
